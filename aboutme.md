# I am an Engineer by academic, an Application Developer by Passion.

I love taking up tasks from initial concept to final launch--thinking about the big picture while delivering on the details. My approach is based on design thinking, lean startup, and agile principles. I believe that great products emerge from developing true empathy for your customers, understanding their problems with clarity, and using iterative development to create simple solutions.

My experiences reflect a holistic interest in bringing technology products to market. They include:
* Self-Driving Car Nano-Degree from Udacity .
* Electronic Engineer in 4ZE Racing 
* Control and Stability of Tri-Rotor Systems
* Application Developer for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles


## Current technology stack:

Autonomous system Development : C++, Python, ROS, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Gazebo
Mobile Development: iOS, Swift, Python, Arduino, Java, Embedded C
Electronic Simulation in PSpice, LABVIEW, Proteus , MATLAB
Electronic controller design , PID Tuning , Battery Management System , PCB Designing.
